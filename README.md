# Generalized Harmonia Mechanics (GHM) Framework  

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/PENDING.svg)](https://doi.org/PENDING)  

## Overview  

This repository contains the **Generalized Harmonia Mechanics (GHM) framework**, a unifying mathematical model for damping, stability, and energy evolution across multiple domains, including:  

- **Fluid Dynamics** (Navier-Stokes equations & turbulence analysis)  
- **Quantum Mechanics** (Wave-packet stability under harmonic corrections)  
- **Cosmology** (Resolution of the Hubble Tension using modified Friedmann equations)  
- **Number Theory** (Analysis of prime gaps & stability functionals)  
- **Generalized Stability Theorems** (Energy decomposition with intrinsic oscillatory modes)  

GHM provides a novel axiomatic framework to **describe stability and damping** by decomposing energy functions into dissipative and oscillatory components, demonstrating fundamental connections between **spectral bridges, turbulence, and cosmic expansion**.

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Contributions  

This work introduces the **GHM Evolution Law**:  

$$\[
\frac{dE}{dt} + \lambda E w(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \cos(2\pi f_n t + \phi_n)
\]$$

where $$\( w(t) \)$$ is a logarithmic renormalization weight function that regulates stability, **linking damping processes across multiple fields**.  

### ðŸŒŒ Key Theoretical Insights
